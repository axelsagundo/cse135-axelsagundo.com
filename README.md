# CSE 135 Project - Online Database Analytics Applications

If you know about Apache Servers, you know that there is a folder named __www__ where your website files live for each domain you have. 

In this class we had to set up a domain and two sub domains. In my case, it was axelsagundo.com, reporting.axelsagundo.com and collector.axelsagundo.com. 

Even though we had to set up the collector.axelsagundo.com subdomain, we did not end up using it for this class. 


# What to look for
The axelsagundo.com public_html folder mostly contains static files. However, there are also some CGI program files written in C, Perl, Python and PHP under the cgi-bin folder. 


In the reporting.axelsagundo.com public_html folder, youll find a lot of Javascript files that essentially handle form submissions, API routes and data reporting.

# Future

At one point, this website was live but it was kind of expensive to keep the server running through Digital Ocean so I decided to take the server down and repurpose my domain to actually host a personal website of mine. 

I am planning to get the server back up and running in the future.
